The Facial Keypoint Detection project uses 6 layer LeNet style convolutional neural network (CNN) to find 68 facial keypoints on a face. The keypoints are positioned on the features of a face, such as the eyebrow, nose, and mouth. The points could therefore be used in a number of applications including emotion detection and facial feature classification.****
